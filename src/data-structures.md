# Data structures

Jesstern Rays, Software Engineer @ ThoughtWorks

---

# Arrays

- Data is stored contiguously (next to each other) in memory
- Makes reading data easy

---

# Linked-lists

---

# Implementing linked-list

```js
class Node {
  constructor() {
    // your code here
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    // your code here
  }
}
```

# Queues

- First in first out (Fifo)
- Resembles a queue for bubble tea

---

# Implementing queue

Q: Should we implement it using an array or a linked-list?

---

# Stacks

- Last in first out (Lifo)
- Resembles a stack of plates
- Used in a programs callstack

---

# Implementing stack

Q: Should we implement it using an array or a linked-list?
